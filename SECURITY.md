## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you encounter any Vulnerability or Error, you can create an GitHub Issue. I will immediately update it, as soon as I fix it or have any new information.

> This can take a bit, as I am still working alone. So please wait after you create an Issue. If i haven't responded after a week, you can write an E-Mail of DM me on Discord.

As soon the vulnerability is accepted, it will be resolved and pushed to the Repository.
If it was declined, we will post a reason and mark it as resolved. No actions will follow.
