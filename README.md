# Kube of the Wild

**Welcome to the Kube of the Wild Project** 
This Project is a kind-of-Addon to the [The Legend of Zelda® in Minecraft® Project](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lmdl2Wu7PO0) of the Youtuber [Grazzy](www.youtube.com/grazzyy). This is a free project, and I do not plan on making any Money with it.
This is only, to make a Player feel Zelda, without Zelda. If this is breaking Copyright, I think Grazzys Map should also fall under Copyright. 

I recommend you use a Mod Manager like Curseforgemor Modrinth for this.

Anyways, I hope you have Fun with this one.

# Installation

This mod needs some Setup to work and Ill walk you through it now:

First, you need to install the Kubejs mod, the newer the better, but it is required to use a Minecraft version above 1.19.2 because of the new Syntax of the mod.
