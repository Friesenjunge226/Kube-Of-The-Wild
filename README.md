# Kube of the Wild

> This Project is _Very_ much work in progress and just has the weapons barely done. Please wait patiently, I'm working on it

**Welcome to the Kube of the Wild Project** 
This Project is a kind-of-Addon to the [The Legend of Zelda® in Minecraft® Project](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lmdl2Wu7PO0) of the Youtuber [Grazzy](www.youtube.com/grazzyy). This is a free project, and I do not plan on making Money with it.

I recommend you use a Mod Manager like [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app) for this.

> This is the main Branch, which will hopefully always work. I'm commiting to this branch only, when a major update is ready. Please respect, that we're a small team.


Anyways, have fun!

# Installation

This mod needs some Setup to work and I will walk you through it now:


First, you need to install the KubeJS Mod, in a Minecraft Version above 1.19.2. So far it has been tested on 1.20.1.
 
 
* [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs)
* [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs/versions)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS)

Download the Kube of the Wild Project in .zip from this Github, unzip it and put it in the Folder of the Minecraft Profile. 

>To open the Folder, click Options (Three dots) and then open folder.

The folder structure should now roughly look like this:

Congratulations, you are ready to start Minecraft.
If you encounter __any__ Errors with KubeJS you can make an Issue, to let me know.
