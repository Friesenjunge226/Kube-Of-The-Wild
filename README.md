# Kube of the Wild

**Welcome to the Kube of the Wild Project** 
This Project is a kind-of-Addon to the [The Legend of Zelda® in Minecraft® Project](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lmdl2Wu7PO0) of the Youtuber [Grazzy](www.youtube.com/grazzyy). This is a free project, and I do not plan on making any Money with it.

I recommend you use a Mod Manager like [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app) for this.

Anyways, have fun!

# Installation

This mod needs some Setup to work and I will walk you through it now:

First, you need to install the Kubejs mod, the newer the better, but it is required to use a Minecraft version above 1.19.2 because of the new Syntax of the mod. I use 1.20.1 because most mods run on it and it has most of the useful features.

*[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs)
*[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs/versions)
*[GitHub](https://github.com/KubeJS-Mods/KubeJS)

Download the Kube of the Wild Project in .zip from this Github, unzip it and put it in the Folder of the Minecraft Profile. 

>To open the Folder, click Options (Three dots) and then open folder.

The folder structure should look like this now: 

"Put image of folder here."

Congratulations, you are ready to start Minecraft.
If you encounter __any__ Errors with KubeJS you can make an Issue, to let me know.
